# PyPortal StreamDeck

Main functions all working:
- Multiple pages
- Next/previous buttons
- Simple button map in the code
- Buttons output keypresses and can include multiple keys simultaneously
- Individual button icons rather than single .bmp for each page
- Icon map in code to easily allocate icons to buttons
- Icons to highlight when pressed to give some feedback/indication that it is working

Next updates:
- Able to toggle icons when pressed (eg mic muted)
